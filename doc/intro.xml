This chapter serves as an introduction of the package &LINS;.

<Section Label="Intro Overview">
<Heading>Overview</Heading>

The package &LINS; provides an algorithm for computing the normal subgroups of a finitely presented group up to some given index bound. <P/>

Moreover it provides an interface for searching in the normal subgroup lattice of a finitely presented group.
For example, one can use this interface to search for <M>l</M> normal subgroups of index <M>n</M>. <P/>

The algorithm is based on work of David Firth <Cite Key="paper"/>.
He implemented that algorithm in the algebra software MAGMA.
That implementation in MAGMA has been revised and rewritten to a great extent by Derek Holt. <P/>

The current implementation in &GAP; uses a table of groups that was computed by the code in <F>createTables.gi</F>.

In this section we present example sessions which demonstrate
how to use the main high-level functions provided by ;. <P/>

<Subsection>
<Heading>Example : all normal subgroups up to index <M>n</M></Heading>

We compute all normal subgroups in <M>D_{50}</M>,
the dihedral group of size <M>50</M>.

<Subsection>
<Heading>Example : all normal subgroups of index <M>n</M></Heading>

We compute all normal subgroups of index <M>5^2 = 25</M> in <M>C_5^4</M>,
the direct product of <M>4</M> copies of the cyclic group of order <M>5</M>:
