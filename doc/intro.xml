This chapter serves as an introduction of the package &SelfIntersectingComplexes;.

<Section Label="Intro Overview">
<Heading>Overview</Heading>

The package &SelfIntersectingComplexes; provides algorithms for retriangulating and computing outer hulls of self-intersecting complexes.  <P/>

Moreover, non-manifold parts can be treated which lead to problems when 3D-printing surfaces. Additionally, symmetric properties of an underlying complex can be used to speed-up algorithms.<P/>

The algorithm is based on the work presented in <Cite Key="paper"/>.
